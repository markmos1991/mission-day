# Street Art Team Building App

The Street Art Team Building App is a web application built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Next.js. It serves as a guide for a team-building activity where teams need to locate and capture street art in Manchester's Northern Quarter. This README file provides an overview of the app's features, setup instructions, and deployment details.

## Features

- **Street Art Locations**: The app provides a list of street art locations in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Users can view the details of each location, including its name, description, and a map displaying its approximate position.
- **Image Upload**: Teams can upload pictures of themselves at the street art locations they find. This feature encourages collaboration and team spirit during the team-building activity.
- **Resource for Visitors**: The app also serves as a resource for visitors to Manchester's Northern Quarter who are interested in exploring the street art scene. They can discover new locations, read about the art pieces, and plan their own self-guided tours.

## Technologies Used

The Street Art Team Building App utilizes the following technologies:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js provides a component-based architecture, enabling reusable and modular UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps in building custom user interfaces with minimal effort. Tailwind CSS offers a wide range of pre-defined utility classes, resulting in fast and responsive designs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability. TypeScript provides features like type checking and autocompletion, reducing the likelihood of errors.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language of the web, used for implementing interactivity and dynamic behavior in the app.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that simplifies server-side rendering, routing, and deployment. Next.js optimizes performance and provides features like serverless functions and automatic code splitting.
- **Vercel**: A cloud platform for deploying web applications. Vercel offers a seamless deployment process, scalability, and hosting capabilities.
